# **E-commerce-Bank-Fraud-Detection**

## **Project Description**

This project focuses on developing advanced machine learning models to accurately detect fraudulent activities in both e-commerce and bank credit transactions. Leveraging comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, and state-of-the-art modeling techniques, the aim is to build robust systems that minimize financial losses and enhance transaction security for financial technology companies.

## **Business Understanding**

Adey Innovations Inc., a leading FinTech company, seeks to improve its fraud detection capabilities. The core challenge lies in the highly imbalanced nature of fraud data, where legitimate transactions vastly outnumber fraudulent ones. A critical trade-off exists between security (minimizing false negatives, i.e., missed fraud) and user experience (minimizing false positives, i.e., incorrectly flagged legitimate transactions). This project addresses these challenges by developing accurate and interpretable models to prevent financial losses and build trust with customers and financial institutions.

## **Project Overview**

This initiative involves a multi-faceted approach to fraud detection:

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Handling diverse transaction datasets, including cleaning, imputation, and type correction.
2. **Geolocation & Temporal Feature Engineering:** Enriching transaction data with geographical context from IP addresses and extracting time-based patterns.
3. **Imbalance Handling:** Applying advanced sampling techniques to address the severe class imbalance inherent in fraud datasets.
4. **Model Development:** Building and comparing various machine learning models, from interpretable baselines (Logistic Regression) to powerful ensemble methods (Gradient Boosting/Random Forest).
5. **Rigorous Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics suitable for imbalanced data, such as AUC-PR and F1-Score, with a focus on the business implications of false positives and false negatives.
6. **Model Explainability (XAI):** Utilizing SHAP values to interpret model decisions, providing transparency and actionable insights into the key drivers of fraud.

## **Key Features**

- **Dual-Dataset Analysis:** Addresses fraud detection for both e-commerce and bank credit transactions.
- **Geolocation Integration:** Merges IP address data to enhance fraud pattern recognition with geographical context.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Creates sophisticated temporal and behavioral features (e.g., transaction velocity, time since signup).
- **Imbalanced Learning Strategies:** Implements techniques like SMOTE or Undersampling to handle skewed class distributions effectively.
- **Comparative Modeling:** Evaluates Logistic Regression and ensemble models (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost) for optimal performance.
- **Explainable AI (SHAP):** Provides clear interpretations of model predictions, highlighting critical fraud indicators.
- **Robust Evaluation Metrics:** Focuses on business-relevant metrics like AUC-PR and F1-Score.

## **Business Objectives**

- **Minimize Financial Losses:** Accurately identify and prevent fraudulent transactions.
- **Enhance Transaction Security:** Strengthen the overall security posture for e-commerce and banking platforms.
- **Improve User Trust:** Reduce false positives to ensure a seamless and trustworthy user experience.
- **Derive Actionable Insights:** Understand the underlying patterns of fraud through model interpretability to inform business strategies.
- **Optimize Operational Efficiency:** Enable quicker and more accurate detection, reducing manual review efforts.
